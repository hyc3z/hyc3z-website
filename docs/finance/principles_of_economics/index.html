household&quot;</p><p><strong>Scarcity</strong> means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have.</p><p><strong>Economics</strong> is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.</p><p>In most societies, resources are allocated not by an all-powerful dictator but through the combined choices of millions of households and firms.</p><p><strong>Principles:</strong></p><p>Decision Making:</p><ul><li><p>People face trade-offs</p><p>&quot;guns and butter&quot;</p><p>Efficiency and Equality</p></li><li><p>The cost of something is what you give up to get it</p><p><strong>Opportunity cost</strong>: what you give up to get the item</p></li><li><p>Rational people think at the margin</p><p><strong>Marginal change</strong>: a small incremental adjustment to a plan of an action</p><p>Rational people make decisions by comparing <em>marginal benefits</em> and <em>marginal costs</em>.</p></li><li><p>People respond to incentives</p><p><strong>Incentive</strong> is something that induces a person to act.</p><p>Seat belt law -&gt; more accidents</p></li></ul><p>How People Interact</p><ul><li><p>Trade can

market outcomes</p><p><strong>Property rights</strong> The ability of an individual to own and exercise control over scarce resources</p><p><strong>Market failure</strong>: A market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently</p><p><strong>Externality</strong>: The impact of one person&#x27;s actions on the well-being of a bystander</p><p>Pollution</p><p><strong>Market power</strong>: The ability of a single economic actor to have a substantial influence on market prices</p><p>Monopoly</p></li></ul><p>How the Economy as a Whole Works</p><ul><li><p>A country&#x27;s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services</p><p><strong>Productivity</strong>: The quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input</p></li><li><p>Prices rise when the government prints too much money</p><p><strong>Inflation</strong>: The increase in the overall level of prices in the economy</p><p>1921
